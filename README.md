# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create this page to make my studying easier. I built this project to act as a one-stop shop for all of the new material I learned during the pre-work modules. By doing this, my notes are all in one place, and it allows me to effectively review content I learned doing the prework modules. By completing this project, I learned how to build a basic web application using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

You can use the Prework Study Guide webpage to review foundational coding concepts. Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. Additionally, if you open the Chrome DevTools console, you can see JavaScript running. The console will include the topics covered during the prework module and it will randomly select a topic for you to study first.
