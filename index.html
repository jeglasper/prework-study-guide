           <li> The head element contain metadata (information needed to for the webpage).</li>
          <li> The meta element contains information needed for the webpage. This content is not visible to the user (except the title which will show up on the tab).</li>
          <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li> The img element allows a developer to insert an image visable to the user. </li>
            <ol>
               <li> src (source) allows the developer to give the precise location of the image for insertion into the webpage.</li>
              <li> alt is important because it provides descriptions of images for screen reader apps. Accessibility is key.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a program language used by developers to define how a webpage is presented to users</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Inline CSS: style is applied to specific HTML tags within the HTML file</li>
              <li>Internal Style Sheet: style is written within the head element within the HTML file</li>
              <li>External CSS Style Sheet: a seperate file used to house all style code; use the link element within the head element of the HTML file to connect the code to the HTML file</li>
            </ol>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A class attribute allows you to assign CCS rules to any element we chose by assigning the rule to an element marked with a class</li>
          <li>The period preceding a class designates the class as a class selector. This allows any element assigned this class to follow the CSS rule assigned to the class</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch you are currently on & if there are any modified or added files; will tell you if you have things you need to commit as well</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switches to a branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: saves all the changes that are ready to be committed</li>
          <li>git commit "notes about changes": saves changes with a comment to be prepared to be pulled into the branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls the code saved in the github cloud to your local computer</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes the code committed to your local computer to github cloud</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code. You can use "var" to give the variable its name and = to define the value of the variable</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array allows you to list multiple pieces of data into one variable. You can use an array with a loop to significantly cut down the lines of code you have to write</li>
          <li>The location of a data item in an array is called an index. The index always starts with 0. The length is the number of data items in an array</li>
          <li>A boolean is a true/false statement</li>
          <li>A number is a numerical value</li>
          <li>A string is text. you let the system know it's text by putting quotes around it.</li>
          <li>An argument is an action you are asking the system to complete</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools: an indispensable developer's tool that I will use throughout the bootcamp and most likley my professional life as well</li>
          <li>The console in Chrome DevTools is a test environment developers use to test their code.</li>
          <li>The .log() is a method (a set of instructions that can be executed by the computer). It will output whatever is inside the () to the console</li>
          <li>Conditional logic and loops are used to disrupt the control flow' it influences the order in which code is executed</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducting decision-making into the code; you can use "else if" to have the code try other statements and react differently within the same conditional statement. You can use else to tell the application what to output if none of the other conditions are met</li>
          <li> === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a noolean result (true or false)</li>
          <li>A loop containes three important statements: 1. The Starting Point of the Loop; 2. The Condition; & 3. allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
